# Analysis

This is a repository filled with some of the things that I look at when I need python to answer a question. Probably 
not the prettiest, but it should help me answer some of the questions I'm asking. Part of what I'm trying to do is learn how to do basic analysis as well as communicate those findings visually. 

I've decided to use plotly because of the interactive nature of their tools, which I feel helps the viewer be more engaged with the data presented. 

I'll probably have some tools in here to help with projects such as data scrapping and data cleaning.

Below is a list of analysis and links to their github repository as well as a notebook viewer which will allow the reader to view the graphs natively in a web browser.
